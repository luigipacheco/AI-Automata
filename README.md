# AI Automata

AI Automata is a real-time strategy game inspired by Globulation 2, with a unique twist - each unit is programmable using a node-based visual scripting language. The programming of each node is assembly-like or python-like (human readable), with each node being programmable and customizable. The game allows players to create and customize their own units, with a focus on programming logic, property upgrades, and strategic planning.

## Game Mechanics

### Node-Based Visual Scripting Language

AI Automata features a node-based visual scripting language, where each node is programmable and customizable. The nodes represent different units, structures, and programming functions, and can be connected to create complex logic flows. The player can program the behavior and capabilities of each unit, such as movement, combat, and special abilities.

### Resource Management

The player must manage various resources, such as energy, raw materials, and technology, to build and upgrade their units and structures. Nodes can be used to represent different resource-gathering and management functions, such as mining, farming, or research.

### Unit Creation and Upgrades

Nodes can be used to represent different units and structures that the player can create and upgrade. Players can use nodes to program the behavior and capabilities of these units, such as movement, combat, and special abilities. Units can be customized and upgraded over time, adding new properties and capabilities.

### Strategic Planning

The game involves a strategic planning aspect, where players use nodes to create battle plans and strategies. Nodes can be used to represent different tactics, such as flanking, ambushing, or retreat. Players can also use nodes to program their units to execute these plans.

### AI and Automata Programming

Nodes can be used to program the behavior of the game's AI and automata units. Players can use nodes to create different AI routines, such as scouting, patrolling, or attacking. They can also use nodes to program the behavior of their own automata units, such as harvesting resources or constructing buildings.

### Blob Evolution and Building Properties

Each blob can evolve into a building, with each building keeping some of the properties of the original blob. Building properties, such as production rate, defense, and resource generation, affect how the building functions in the game and allow players to create different types of buildings based on their strategic needs.

### Programming Challenges and Tutorials

The node editor window includes programming challenges and tutorials, providing guidance and tips for players who are new to programming or who are looking to improve their programming skills.
